### Hey there, I'm Lina  :smile:

I am a passionate Cloud Architect & Manager with a strong background in developing, deploying, and maintaining scalable applications and infrastructures. </br> Engineering is in my DNA; I was fortunate to grow up as the daughter of a respected Engineer and STEM professor who introduced me early to the world of robotics, igniting my passion for technology and science. With a decade of experience across game and website development, mobile applications, cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity, I continuously broaden my skill set and contribute to technological advancements. I am dedicated to advocating for the tech community by creating open-source materials, speaking at conferences, and facilitating bootcamps to inspire and empower others.
